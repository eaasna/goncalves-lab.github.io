title: Introducing the lab

Our group aims to understand the processes of somatic and regulatory genome evolution during ageing and carcinogenesis. We combine experimental approaches with bioinformatic analyses and statistical modelling, with a long-term view of improving the early detection of cancer.

### Research

It has long been known that mutant clonal evolution by natural selection plays a defining role in the development of cancer. However, this process has been challenging to study in detail prior to the development of cost-effective high-throughput Next-Generation Sequencing. Using NGS, alterations present in even very small proportions of cells can now be detected. Modelling these alterations can in turn improve our understanding of the emergence of mutant alleles within tissues. Moreover, recently developed single cell RNA sequencing methods can be used to identify somatic mutations in individual cells and assess their effects on the expression of genes, an approach that has been highly informative in the interpretation of the effects of germline variation. A major component of our work is therefore to interpret and develop novel methods for the analysis of NGS data in the context of cancer evolution.

Another component of our work is the more general understanding and prediction of genotype to phenotype relationships. For this, we contribute through the development of computational methods for high-dimensional data, including tools for feature selection and differential testing.

### Projects

* Somatic mutations in normal and pre-malignant human gynaecological tissues
* Ageing of reproductive mouse tissues
* Methods development for single-cell RNA-seq

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://goncalves-lab.github.io/index.html) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
