  Hi there! Welcome to our lab webpage
</p>

Our group aims to understand the processes of somatic and regulatory genome evolution during ageing and carcinogenesis. We combine experimental approaches with bioinformatic analyses and statistical modelling, with a long-term view of improving the early detection of cancer.
